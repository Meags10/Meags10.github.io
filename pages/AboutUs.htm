                  <h3>Location: 5159 6th Avenue, Kenosha, Wisconsin 53140</h3>
                  <br>
                    <p>
                     Harborside Common Grounds is conveniently located in downtown Kenosha on the corner of 52nd Street and 6th Avenue. Our coffee shop overlooks the Kenosha Harbor and is walking distance from the train station and bus station. It is also located just a trolly ride away from many of the downtown attractions, including the Kenosha Public Museums and Kenosha Harbor Market.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Constructed in the 1920s, the building which houses Harborside Common Grounds was originally a fish market. Fishermen would dock their boats in the harbor and unload their catch into the basement of the building, which was heavily insulted to keep the fish cold and fresh. On the first floor, where customers could purchase their fish, there is still a small cut out in one of the windows, much like a box office, where customers would pay for their purchase.</p>
                    <br>   
                    <p>In September of 2000, Harborside Common Grounds opened its doors and served up the first of many delicious espresso drinks! Quickly the little coffee shop - which started as an inside joke between friends -
                    became a well known business in the downtown Kenosha area. Since then, Harborside Common Grounds has become a delightful place to grab a coffee, catch up with friends, and enjoy the beautiful view of Lake Michigan from our deck. We've even been voted the best coffee shop in Kenosha County three years in a row!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, in order to maintain a traditional coffee house atmosphere, please be aware that Harborside Common Grounds does not offer WiFi and our baristas will grudgingly peg you as a Common Grounds newbie should you choose to ask, "Hey, what's the password for the WiFi?" Sorry! No WiFi here! While we don't mind students or other individuals working on their laptops or other devices, it is our intention that Harborside smell the coffee! Therefore, it is our goal to create an environment in which one can sit quietly with a book or engage in conversation with friends and family. And, to further encourage time away from our screens, the shop has multiple book shelves lined with a variety of take-one-leave-one books and a plentiful supply of board games - just ask the staff if you can't find them! You're more than welcome to bring your own board games, too!</p>
                    <br>   
                    <p>In addition to encouraging comradery amongst friends, Harborside Common Grounds is also focused on creating a sense of community amongst the local downtown buisnesses. The walls of the coffee shop are lined with artwork from Lemon Street Gallery, a local artist cooperative located in Kenosha. The art is rotated every three months and is available for purchase at Harborside Common Grounds and down the street at Lemon Street Gallery. We also partner with Elsie May's Canning and Ambrosia Juice Co. to bring you homemade pie by the slice and a variety of fresh squeezed juices. The local goodies sell fast, though! So get here before they're gone!</p>
                    <br>   
                    <p>Lastly, we'd like to give a shout out to our many, amazing customers! We have seen many friendly faces come and go, but we are incredibly grateful for the kind and coffee-loving customers that make serving up lattes more fun than we ever could have imagined! Thus, we would like to sincerely thank you for your enthusiasm, patience, sense of humor, and for your continued contributions to your local barista's college fund! Happy Coffee-Drinking!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Be nice to your barista; if it's 7am, we probably haven't had our coffee yet, either. We'll get through this together.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Don't order your drink like you've just walked into a franchise. We take pride in our traditional-style coffee and we appreciate you taking the time to ask us about it!</li>
                <br>
                <li>We're not trying to trick you when we say we can't make an "iced cappuccino". Cappuccinos are mostly foam, which doesn't hold up well over ice.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Those other guys are trying to trick you! A real caramel macchiato is espresso with a splash of steamed milk, a bit of caramel, and a dollop of foam.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Your coffee mug is not a waste receptical for napkins and empty sugar packets. We offer 8 strategically placed garbage cans throughout the shop, we kindly ask that you place your garbage there.</li>
                <br>
                <li>If you ask a stupid question you will receive a stupid answer. Laugh it off. We all struggle a little before we've had our caffeine fix.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Have a sense of humor! It's our good humored customers and staff that make Common Grounds such a great place to kick back and relax!</li>
                <br>
                <li>If there is a line to the door, please be considerate. Our staff is fairly small, but we're working our hardest to make your drinks in a timely manner! A little patience goes a long ways!</li>
                <br>
                <li>"Please" and "Thank You" haven't gone out of style. Apply liberally while placing your drink order.</li>
                <br>
                <li>When we call out a drink order, please make sure it belongs to you before walking off with it. Accidents happen, but you'll be much happier, we'll be much happier, and the guy whose drink you just walked off at won't be tapping his foot impatiently while we scramble to make him a new drink. </li>

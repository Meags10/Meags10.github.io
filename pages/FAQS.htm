            <h4>When does the deck open?</h4>
        
            <div>Typically, the deck is open at the beginning of May. However, due to Wisconsin's unpredictable weather patterns, this is not always possible. In addition, the deck will only be open on days when the weather permits.

            <br>
            <h4>Do you have WiFi?</h4>

            <h4>Am I allowed to bring my pet on the deck?</h4>
            <div>As much as the staff would love to have dogs in the coffee shop, we can't allow pets on the deck or in the shop. However, your pet is more than welcome to join you at the picnic tables and benches in front of the shop. We also offer water dishes for our four legged friends.
                </div>
            <br>
            <h4>Where does your art come from?</h4>
            <div>All of our art is from Lemon Street Gallery, a cooperative of local artists from the Kenosha area. They choose the pieces, we sell them. Pieces are rotated every three months and are also on display at Lemon Street Art Gallery on the corner of Sheridan Road and 46th Street in downtown Kenosha. 
                </div>
            <br>
            <h4>Can I sell my art here?</h4>
            <div>Unfortunately we only allow Lemon Street Gallery to hang their work at Common Grounds. If you are an artist who is interested in hanging artwork up at Common Grounds, please talk to Lemon Street Gallery.
